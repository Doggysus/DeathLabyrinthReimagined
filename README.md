# Running.
To run project you need get one version from realeases or compile it youself. Before that you need a server. Get one of server cores like https://papermc.io/downloads/paper (1.21). After launching server put DeathLabyrinth jar file into plugins folder and reload server.

If something broke during the game and you do not want to restart the server, you can try to use the command `/reload_game full` (It will completely reset the current run), if this does not help, then without restarting the server is unlikely to do.

# Rooms
You can add your own rooms to the game. To do this you need to select a built room in the world with worldedit and use the command `/scem <name> scem`. You will then be able to find a schematic of your room in the WorldEdit plugin folder. Place it in the DeathLabyrinth rooms folder (plugins/DeathLabyrinth/rooms) and reload the plugin with the `/reload_game` command. The plugin will then generate a config for your room. Configure the room through it and reload the plugin again.
